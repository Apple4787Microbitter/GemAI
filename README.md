# GemAI
This is GemAI. An AI app that uses ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo, Perplexity, Gemini APIs to connect to these models in a streamlined polished SwiftUI design.

## How do I get GemAI?
You need a few things to get started. 

## The Sideloading Config Profile to prevent Apple from revoking. 
  ### Step 1: Open this link on your iPhone!: https://bit.ly/4iXCctw
  This will download the DNS to prevent revokes.
  
## The Actual Sideloading (computer)
  ### Step 1: Download Sideloadly: https://sideloadly.io/
  ### Step 2: Open the program and under the Apple ID section, Sign In! (btw this is safe, because it only sends data to Apple, they dont collect it)
  ### Step 3: Put in the IPA file you downloaded from releases. (the latest one) to this spot: <img width="108" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-28 at 5 45 26â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddbd0865-c63e-4637-97f4-cfa70fdb2fd4" />
  ### Step 4: Plug in your iPhone with a cable, then select it under the iDevice section
  ### Step 5: Click Start.
  ### This will sideload my app onto your iPhone (If you dont pay Apple a 100 EUR/USD a year, than you have to "resign" it every 7 days. (thanks apple)

### Once you have the app, prepare for Onboarding

# Get your API key/keys. You dont need to add all 3, to obtain the keys, I will put links.
## Perplexity: https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/getting-started (adding perplexity is worth it if you have Pro, because Pro users get free 5 dollah dollah bonus each month. One request is: 1 cent.
## Gemini: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey (Gemini, you have to click create API key, this is free.)
## ChatGPT: (I have never tested ChatGPT because I didnt pay for my key, therefore it's not free) Pricing: https://openai.com/api/pricing/ API key page: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

## Once you have the keys you want to add (again, not necessary to add all) open GemAI, and click each box and type in your key/keys. The keys you don't want to add you can click the skip button. Once you typed in your keys, click "Get Started". You have set up GemAI correctly, you can start using GemAI.
